> A visual novel about the beauty of things, and the sadness of their passing.

## Story

**Sakura** is a kinetic visual novel (with no choices) that explores the Japanese aesthetic of **Mono no Aware (物の哀れ)** — the poignant awareness of impermanence, a gentle sadness at the beauty of things that are transient.

Set in the Edo period of Japan, the story follows **Sōya**, the young heir to the powerful Asakawa family, and **Ona**, the orphaned daughter of a low-ranking retainer. Their innocent childhood bond deepens into a profound affection, symbolized by a simple hairpin and a promise to view the cherry blossoms together.

However, their fragile happiness is threatened by the rigid demands of family duty and political marriage. **Sakura** is a slow, atmospheric tragedy that traces the complete lifecycle of an emotion—from its pure beginning, through its struggle against fate, to its quiet dissolution in the relentless flow of time.

## Features

*   **A Complete "Mono no Aware" Narrative:** A nine-chapter structure meticulously designed to evoke a deep sense of beauty and melancholy.
*   **Atmospheric Art:** A collection of evocative background art and CGs in a 16:9 aspect ratio, capturing the stark beauty of each season and the emotional tone of the story.
*   **Expressive Character Sprites:** Detailed character art that evolves with the protagonists, from childhood to adulthood, reflecting their inner turmoil and resignation.
*   **Original Soundtrack:** A custom soundtrack designed to immerse the player in the world, featuring tranquil, tense, and sorrowful themes that complement the narrative.
*   **Kinetic Novel:** A linear experience focused on delivering a powerful and specific emotional journey, without branching paths or gameplay choices.
